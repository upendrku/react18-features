/* 
Strict Mode enables the following development-only behaviors:
    * Your components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.
    * Your components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.
    * Your components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.

If a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. 
However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable 
(thatâ€™s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.
