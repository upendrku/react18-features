# React 18 Summary

This file summarizes all the React 18 hooks, with the most important key points specific to each hook to remember for an interview for a senior software developer.

## Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook is used to manage state in functional components. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function to update the state value.

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to run side effects in functional components. It takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed after the component is mounted and whenever the component's props or state change.

### useContext

The `useContext` hook is used to access context data in functional components. It takes a context object as an argument and returns the current value of the context data.

### useRef

The `useRef` hook is used to create a ref object in functional components. The ref object can be used to access a DOM element or other value from within the component.

### useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is used to manage state in functional components using reducers. It takes a reducer function as an argument and returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function to dispatch actions.

### useMemo

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize a value in functional components. It takes a callback function as an argument and returns the result of the callback function the first time it is called, and then the memoized value for subsequent calls.

### useCallback

The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize a function in functional components. It takes a callback function as an argument and returns a memoized version of the callback function.

### useRefCallback

The `useRefCallback` hook is used to create a ref object that contains a memoized function. It takes a callback function as an argument and returns a ref object that contains the memoized function.

### useLayoutEffect

The `useLayoutEffect` hook is similar to the `useEffect` hook but is executed after the layout has been calculated. This can be useful for effects that need to be executed after the DOM has been rendered.

### useDebugValue

The `useDebugValue` hook is used to debug values in functional components. It takes a value and an optional object of options as arguments. The options object can be used to customize the label and value that are rendered in the React DevTools.

### useTransition

The `useTransition` hook is used to manage transitions in functional components. It takes a configuration object as an argument and returns an object with two values: the current transition state and a function to update the transition state.

### useDeferredValue

The `useDeferredValue` hook is used to defer the evaluation of a value. It takes a value as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to the value after a delay.

### useSyncExternalStore

The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is used to subscribe to an external store. It takes an external store function as an argument and returns the current value of the external store.

### useId

The `useId` hook is used to generate a unique ID for a component. The hook returns a string that can be used to identify the component.

### useImperativeHandle

The `useImperativeHandle` hook is used to expose a mutable ref to a component. The hook takes a ref object as an argument, and the hook returns a function that can be used to update the ref object.

## React 18 Built-in Components

This README file provides information about the built-in components of React 18 and their functionalities.

### Fragment

The `Fragment` component is a lightweight component that does not add any extra nodes to the DOM. It can be used to group a list of children without having to wrap them in a div or other container element. Using the `Fragment` component can help improve the performance of your application and enhance code readability.

Example Usage:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <ChildComponent1 />
      <ChildComponent2 />
      <ChildComponent3 />
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```

### Profiler

The `Profiler` component enables measuring the cost of rendering a component and its descendants. It is a useful tool for debugging performance problems and identifying components that may be causing performance bottlenecks. By collecting performance data, you can optimize your application's rendering process.

Example Usage:

```jsx
import React, { Profiler } from 'react'

function App() {
  const onRender = (
    id,
    phase,
    actualDuration,
    baseDuration,
    startTime,
    commitTime
  ) => {
    console.log(`Component ${id} took ${actualDuration}ms to render`)
  }

  return (
    <Profiler id="MyComponent" onRender={onRender}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Profiler>
  )
}
```

### StrictMode

The `StrictMode` component enables strict mode for a component and its descendants. Strict mode enforces a set of rules that help prevent common mistakes and errors in React code. Enabling strict mode can improve code quality, identify potential problems, and catch potential errors early.

Example Usage:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function App() {
  return (
    <React.StrictMode>
      <MyComponent />
    </React.StrictMode>
  )
}
```

### Suspense

The `Suspense` component is used to render a fallback UI while a resource is loading. It helps improve the user experience by preventing users from seeing a blank screen while resources, such as data from an API or a large file, are loading. The `Suspense` component simplifies handling asynchronous operations in your application.

Example Usage:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```
