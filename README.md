# React 18 Hooks Summary

This file summarizes all the React 18 hooks, with the most important key points specific to each hook to remember for an interview for a senior software developer.

## Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook is used to manage state in functional components. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function to update the state value.

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to run side effects in functional components. It takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed after the component is mounted and whenever the component's props or state change.

### useContext

The `useContext` hook is used to access context data in functional components. It takes a context object as an argument and returns the current value of the context data.

### useRef

The `useRef` hook is used to create a ref object in functional components. The ref object can be used to access a DOM element or other value from within the component.

### useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is used to manage state in functional components using reducers. It takes a reducer function as an argument and returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function to dispatch actions.

### useMemo

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize a value in functional components. It takes a callback function as an argument and returns the result of the callback function the first time it is called, and then the memoized value for subsequent calls.

### useCallback

The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize a function in functional components. It takes a callback function as an argument and returns a memoized version of the callback function.

### useRefCallback

The `useRefCallback` hook is used to create a ref object that contains a memoized function. It takes a callback function as an argument and returns a ref object that contains the memoized function.

### useLayoutEffect

The `useLayoutEffect` hook is similar to the `useEffect` hook but is executed after the layout has been calculated. This can be useful for effects that need to be executed after the DOM has been rendered.

### useDebugValue

The `useDebugValue` hook is used to debug values in functional components. It takes a value and an optional object of options as arguments. The options object can be used to customize the label and value that are rendered in the React DevTools.

### useTransition

The `useTransition` hook is used to manage transitions in functional components. It takes a configuration object as an argument and returns an object with two values: the current transition state and a function to update the transition state.

### useDeferredValue

The `useDeferredValue` hook is used to defer the evaluation of a value. It takes a value as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to the value after a delay.

### useSyncExternalStore

The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is used to subscribe to an external store. It takes an external store function as an argument and returns the current value of the external store.

### useId

The useId hook is used to generate a unique ID for a component. The hook returns a string that can be used to identify the component.

### useImperativeHandle

The useImperativeHandle hook is used to expose a mutable ref to a component. The hook takes a ref object as an argument, and the hook returns a function that can be used to update the ref object.
